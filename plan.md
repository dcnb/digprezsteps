## Digital Preservation Plan Template

This document lays out some sections and questions for a basic preservation plan. We have also created a form for you to fill out that should help advance this process. Click on the button on the right to fill out the form. The questions and notes below will help assist you to create a document as well. 

### Section 1 - Rationale:

This is the “why” of having a digital preservation program and should include portions of your mission, how the program relates to it, and the importance of digital preservation to the ongoing success of digital collections and archives.

- What does your program do?  
- For whom are you preserving this material, both now and in the future? To what purpose?
- Why do you practice digital preservation for your digital content?

### Section 2 - Scope:

This section should describe “what” the department/program does, and should focus on collection development strategies, audience, and collaboration.

- What does your program digitize? How are these decisions made? You can format this as a simple paragraph or a bulleted list. Including collection development plans in this area should also work.  
- Does your program work with other departments or programs to do what it does? Who? What is the relationship?

### Section 3 - Operating Procedures and Strategies:

This section of the plan covers the details of “how” the program operates, and should lay out how an organization can meet or work to meet various levels of the NDSA's Levels of Digital Preservation].

#### [Storage and Geographic Location](storage.html):

- Where are your files kept physically?  
- Are they located on internal hard drives, or at a remote location? Both?  
- How often are your files backed up?


#### [File Fixity and Data Integrity](fixity.html):

“File Fixity is a digital preservation term referring to the property of a digital file being fixed, or unchanged. ... Within the repository, fixity checking is used to ensure that digital files have not been affected by data rot or other digital preservation dangers.” (Wikipedia)

- How often files are checked for fixity (data rot and data loss) and data integrity?
- What program do you use to perform fixity checks?


#### [Security](security.html):

- Who has access to the archival materials?
- What is the chain of command for read, write, delete, and move authority?  
- Who makes changes to files or formats? What are the procedures for documenting any change?  


#### [Metadata](metadata.html):

- What are the metadata procedures your institution or program abides by?  
- What types of metadata do you keep?(options: transformative, administrative, descriptive, and technical)  


#### [File Formats](formats.html)

- How many of each file format do you have?, be specific to the types of files (text, moving image, still image, audio, etc.).  
- What are the naming conventions for your files? Are there any exceptions to the naming rules?
- What is the plan, schedule, and selected software component for any necessary format migrations that can be perceived down the line?  
- What is schedule for assessing file outdatedness? How often are files updated once format migration is decided?
