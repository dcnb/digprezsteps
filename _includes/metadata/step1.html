<ol>
<li>Create your digital object inventory &ndash; Conduct a high level overview of digital assets (including born-digital content!), capturing the following information (an <a href="assets/overview_of_digital_assets-Template.xlsx">excel spreadsheet</a> at this point is just fine):
<br/><br/>

<ul>
<li> Size of existing collection: number of items and storage requirements</li>
<li> Storage location - where and how much redundancy (i.e. how many copies)?</li>
<li> Format of objects</li>
<li> Relationships between objects</li>
<li> Anticipated growth rate- existing and new collections</li>
<li> Existing metadata (Technical, Administrative, Descriptive, etc.)</li>
<li> Copyright/ access restrictions</li>
<li> Search functionality for objects</li>
<li> Vulnerabilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where are you storing your inventory? Make sure it is in two places, both within and separate from the content of your collections.</li>
</ol>
