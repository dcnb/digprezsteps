<p>Being able to attest to the <a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2014/04/protect-your-data-file-fixity-and-data-integrity/">fixity</a> and integrity of the materials an organization is to preserve is essential. Verifying a file’s fixity is typically accomplished by generating, recording, and monitoring a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a>. Generating a checksum is a process that maps a file’s data to a bit string of a fixed size in the form of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash</a>. This hash is stored and compared during file movements and can be used to verify the integrity of files in a storage environment. Checksums are important in that they establish a <a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2011/11/hashing-out-digital-trust/?loclr=blogsig">chain of trust</a> between the object, the file system, and the user. </p>
