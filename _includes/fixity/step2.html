<p>Moving from level 1 to level 2 in the framework means that, in addition to actively creating and verifying fixity for all ingested content, you are selectively using write protection and virus checks as you ingest born-digital files into your system(s).</p>
<p>Employing write protections means that you are using a computer hard disk controller (<a href="http://forensicswiki.org/wiki/Write_Blockers">write-blocker</a>) made for the purpose of gaining read-only access to computer hard drives/media without damaging the contents or inadvertently altering the metadata. Changes can be made at the time of connection even if you do not issue an explicit command or action within the operating system.

<p>It is always important to scan all born-digital content for viruses no matter where the files originate. This is typically done just after the transfer process so that the source files are not altered. ClamAV is a popular open source antivirus software being used in libraries and archival organizations. The software is part of the &ldquo;stack&rdquo; in the <a href="https://projecthydra.org">Hydra Project</a>, is an integral part of <a href="https://www.bitcurator.net">BitCurator</a>, and is a core microservices within the popular digital preservation system <a href="https://wiki.archivematica.org/Main_Page">Archivematica</a>. </p>
