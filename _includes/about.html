<p>Digital Preservation Step by Step was created by the Orbis Cascade Alliance to assist those responsible for digital preservation activities at their respective institutions to assess and improve their practices in various digital preservation areas. </p>
<p>We use the National Digital Stewardship Alliance’s</span> <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/documents/NDSA_Levels_Archiving_2013.pdf">Levels of Digital Preservation</span></a> <span>and the CCD Digital Preservation Working Group’s</span> <a href="DigitalPreservationWGReport.pdf"><span>own report</span></a> <span>assessing the Orbis Cascade Alliance member libraries’ alignment with those levels as a baseline for instruction.</span></p>

<p>You can also find <a href="policy.html">digital preservation policy templates, guidelines, and examples</a> to help those interested in completing a digital preservation policy for their institutions.</p>
