<p>Unless you manage your own storage, you do not necessarily need to have a technical plan; this will more likely be a contract or agreement with your storage provider (whether your institution's IT or an outside entity). This plan should address issues like: Who is responsible for the storage environment? Who pays for it? Is the funding stable? Who determines if and when to migrate? Who oversees the migration? Being able to make this plan requires a certain level of institutional communication and commitment. If there is no commitment to long term planning, this step might not be able to be fulfilled.</p>
