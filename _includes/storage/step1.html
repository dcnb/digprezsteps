<p>The first step toward level one is essentially making a backup, so that recovery is possible if one system fails. This could range from an external hard drive to regular computer back-ups to a storage system managed by your institution's IT department. At this stage, a second copy on external hard drives is preferable to nothing, but be aware that it will take some effort and organization to keep copies in sync.</p>

<p>Another part of achieving level one is to transfer content from heterogeneous media and onto a storage system. 'Heterogeneous media' might be floppy discs, CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, ad-hoc internal or external hard drives, and thumb or flash drives. These aren't appropriate storage spaces for digital preservation. Even opening files can potentially alter files or embedded metadata of files, so before you start working, read OCLC's <a href="http://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/publications/library/2012/2012-06.pdf"><em>You've Got to Walk Before You Can Run: First Steps for Managing Born-Digital Content Received on Physical Media</em></a>.</p>
