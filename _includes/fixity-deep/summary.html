<p>Verifying a file&rsquo;s fixity is typically accomplished by generating, recording, and monitoring a checksum. Running a checksum is process that maps data to a bit string of a fixed size in the form of a <em>cryptographic hash</em>. This hash is stored and compared during file movements and can be used to verify the integrity of files in a storage environment. Checksums are important in that they establish a chain of trust between the object and the filesystem. </p>
