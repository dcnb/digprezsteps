<p>Moving from level 1 to level 2 in the framework means that, in addition to actively creating and verifying fixity for all ingested content, you are selectively using write protection and virus checks for certain content.</p>
<p>A write-blocker, or forensic bridge device, is a computer hard disk controller made for the purpose of gaining read-only access to computer hard drives/media without the risk of damaging the contents or inadvertently altering the metadata. Changes can be caused at the time of connection even if you do not issue an explicit command or action within the operating system. Most manufactures of forensic bridges produce both portable and workstation drive-bay versions. Most devices provide a wide variety of host connections including USB 3.0 &amp; FireWire 800 and support standard hard disk drives and solid-state drives (SSD). There are also write-blockers made specifically for memory cards and USB drives. Starting costs for write-blockers range from $150 to $400 depending on the media type you are working with.  Popular write blocker manufacturers include <a href="https://www2.guidancesoftware.com/products/Pages/tableau/products/forensic-bridges.aspx">Tableau</a> and <a href="http://www.cru-inc.com/products/wiebetech/">Wiebetech</a>.</p>
