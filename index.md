<span>This website is meant to assist those responsible for digital preservation activities at their respective institutions to assess and improve their practices in various digital preservation areas. We use the National Digital Stewardship Alliance’s</span> [<span>Levels of Digital Preservation</span>](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/documents/NDSA_Levels_Archiving_2013.pdf) <span>and the CCD Digital Preservation Working Group’s</span> [<span>own report</span>](https://www.orbiscascade.org/file_viewer.php?id=4169) <span>assessing the Orbis Cascade Alliance member libraries’ alignment with those levels as a baseline for instruction.</span>


## How to use

The easiest way to use this site is simply to browse the material found on the various pages and use the material to learn about ways to improve your practices from one level to the next. We've also provided some more in-depth [instructions](instructions.html) on how to use this site after performing a self-assessment. 

 You can also find [digital preservation policy templates, guidelines, and examples](policy.html) to help those interested in completing a digital preservation policy for their institutions.
